# keeper.htb üê±‚Äçüë§

to begin, i started by running a service scan with nmap <br><br>
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-tigges/htb/main/screenies/nmap.png "initial nmap scan")<br>
######try: nmap -sV <ip>
looks like only 2 ports are open. <br>
> 80 : http <br>
> 22 : ssh <br>


OpenSSH is being used, v8.9 which is a bit outdated, potentially vulnerable‚Ä¶ but let's look at nginx first. <br>
**NOTE:** add the hostname from the nmap scan (keeper.htb) to /etc/hosts <br><br>
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-tigges/htb/main/screenies/website.png "website langing page")<br>
the site resolves to this. lets also add tickets.keeper.htb to our hosts as well and see where it takes us <br><br>
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-tigges/htb/main/screenies/login_portal.png "login portal")<br>
tickets.keeper.htb resolves to a login portal. the site is using Best Practical‚Äôs Request Tracker 4.4.4 <br>
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-tigges/htb/main/screenies/wiki_page.png "RT documentation")<br>
perhaps we'll get lucky and we can use some default RT 4.4.4 creds to sign in? <br>
some quick digging through RT‚Äôs docs I found some default creds. <br><br>
> root:password <br>
lets try the default creds. <br><br>
[!alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-tigges/htb/main/screenies/login_as_root.png "default creds") <br>
nice <br>
<br>
soooo next up lets also check if these creds work with SSH ? <br><br>
[!alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-tigges/htb/main/screenies/ssh1.png "ssh fail") <br>
no luck. <br>
<br>
poking around the RT panel a bit, i found some other user account information in Admin -> Users -> Select <br><br>
[! alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-tigges/htb/main/screenies/users.png "user accounts") <br>
looking at the user ‚Äòlnorgaard‚Äô there‚Äôs some hardcoded creds in his user description‚Ä¶
[!alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-tigges/htb/main/screenies/user_comment.png "user description")
> lnorgaard:Welcome2023! <br>
nice, maybe we can use these to login to the site? <br>
but first im interested in trying to ssh with these credentials. <br><br>
[!alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-tigges/htb/main/screenies/ssh2.png "ssh success") <br>
nice! successful connection and we have a user flag. <br>
<br>
now that im on the machine lets see what ‚Äòlnorgaard‚Äô can do as su, if anything. <br><br>
######: sudo -l <br>

No luck. <br>
<br>
Soooooo let's see what‚Äôs in the zip instead. <br><br>
######: less <file> <br>


Looks juicy. Lets see if we can extract it to our host.
######: cURL, WGET, SCP ‚Ä¶ etc

I used scp in this case.
######: (scp <user>@<ip>:<file> ./<out-file>)

















Once extracted, we get two files ‚ÄòKeePassDumpFull.dmp‚Äô and ‚Äòpasscodes.kdbx‚Äô
Lets see if we can extract any info from the dump?
I found the following tool on github: https://github.com/vdohney/keepass-password-dumper 
(KeePass-Password-Dumper)
For some reason this shit would not work in my Kali box because of outdated .NET sdk and it was annoying me so I copied the file to my host env, Windows 10.


After running the tool we‚Äôre given the following output. This looks like gibberish or a different language?

Goog suggests perhaps there‚Äôs a small typo or missing info? Looks like ‚Äòdgr√∏d med fl√∏de‚Äô is supposed to be ‚Äòr√∏dgr√∏d med fl√∏de‚Äô which means Red Berry Pudding (possible passphrase?)







Let‚Äôs see if this is the master passphrase for the keepass file. 
I installed the KeePass ‚Äòkpcli tools‚Äô on my kali box to look at the file in my terminal.

Try: kpcli, then open <file> and enter the passphrase when prompted


Nice, looks like it worked lol.

I looked inside passcodes, there‚Äôs a bunch of sub-dirs and the only one with info is Network.






Quick Googling of kpcli commands, I found that the ‚Äòshow‚Äô command lets you peer into entries.

Looks like there‚Äôs potentially some root creds in here?
root:F4><3K0nd!
Lets try to ssh with them now‚Ä¶

Looks like it's not gonna work. However, we do have a PuTTy key here. PuTTy is an ssh client, so let's see if we can make our own key with this info and then try a regular ssh with it?

I made a file called ‚Äòkey‚Äô in the .ppk format (private-putty-key) and then from here we need to convert it to a standard ssh usable key format such as .pem, and not the putty-proprietary format for their client.

Using the puttygen utility I created the following pem file.












Now we can try to ssh using our new key.

Looks like it worked! 
We can access the root flag from here. 

Success!
